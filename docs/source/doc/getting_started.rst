Getting started

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
We use some functions of our `toolbox for inference and forecast of the spread of the Coronavirus <https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference/>`_. We supply this toolbox via a github submodule, which has to be initialized while cloning the repository!

.. code-block:: console

		git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Priesemann-Group/covid19_npis_europe.git

Next we install all required python libaries and should be ready to run the scripts afterwards.

.. code-block:: console

		pip install -r requirements.txt


Running the scripts

In the scripts folder we supply our main entry points for the simulations and data gathering. There are multiple scripts for multiple purposes:
